  /* The second field, d_name, is suspect and should be changed to CString
   * as soon as breaking changes are allowed after 0.5.0.
   *
   * The handling of d_name across operating systems is complex. All, so far,
   * agree that the field is a null-terminated array of characters, a.k.a
   * CString.
   *
   * Guarantees of the allocated size of that CString are stated but
   * unreliable.  Some operating systems do not specify NAME_MAX.
   * Some specify it as 255 but can return a string longer than that.
   * macOS specifies 255 UTF-8 characters. Since each UTF-8 character
   * can be up to, currently, 5 bytes long, the total size can
   * exceed the _256 here.
   *
   * Using a CString here, follows the Open Group 'char   d_name[]'.
   * By C rules, that is equivalent to 'char *', a.k.a CString.

  /* Code in dirent.c manually checks that the sizes & declarations
   * of this structure are compatible with the operating system definitions.
   * Devo: if you change anything here, please examine the dirent.c checks.
   *
   * Re: lack of ino_t.
   *     One would expect to see the _1 field below declared as ino_t.
   *     The CUnsignedLongLong is surprising but should not be changed.
   *     dirent.c defines its idea of a Scala Native dirent using "long long".
   *     That gives 64 bytes on both 32 & 64 bit systems.
   *
   *     Scala Native defines 'ino_t' as CUnsignedLong, which is 32 bits
   *     on a 32 bit system.  Using CUnsignedLongLong (guaranteed 64 bits)
   *     allocates space sufficient for  both the 32 & 64 bit cases.
   *     It also is robust to dirent.c being compiled with
   *     _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 on 32 bit systems, perhaps by user specified
   *     compilation flags.
