 *
 *  Extension to the ISO C standard: The functionality described is an extension
 *  to the ISO C standard. Application developers may make use of an extension
 *  as it is supported on all POSIX.1-2017-conforming systems.
 *
 *  All the methods declared in this file and not libc.stdlib are Open Group
 *  extensions to the ISO/IEC C standard.
 *
 *  A method with an XSI comment indicates it is defined in extended POSIX
 *  X/Open System Interfaces, not base POSIX.
 *
 *  A method with an ADV comment indicates it Open Group 2018 "Advisory
 *  Information" meaning, from the specification: "The functionality described
 *  is optional. The functionality described is also an extension to the ISO C
