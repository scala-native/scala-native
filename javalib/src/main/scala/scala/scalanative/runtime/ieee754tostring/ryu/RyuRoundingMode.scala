//    1) This work is a heavily modified derivation of the original work by
//       Ulf Adams at URL: https://github.com/ulfjack/ryu.
//       As such, it inherits the Apache license of the original work.
//       Thank you Ulf Adams.
//
//    2) The original java sources were converted to a rough draft of
//       scala code using the service at URL: javatoscala.com.
//
//       The raw conversion did not compile and contained bugs due
//       to the handling of break and return statements, but it saved
//       days, if not weeks, of effort.
//
//       Thank you javatoscala.com.
//
//    3) All additional work, including introduced bugs,  is an original
//       contribution to Scala Native development.
