// Ported from https://www.hboehm.info/gc/gc_bench/GCBench.java
//
//   This is adapted from a benchmark written by John Ellis and Pete Kovac
//   of Post Communications.
//   It was modified by Hans Boehm of Silicon Graphics.
//
//   	This is no substitute for real applications.  No actual application
//  	is likely to behave in exactly this way.  However, this benchmark was
//  	designed to be more representative of real applications than other
//  	Java GC benchmarks of which we are aware.
//  	It attempts to model those properties of allocation requests that
//  	are important to current GC techniques.
//  	It is designed to be used either to obtain a single overall performance
//  	number, or to give a more detailed estimate of how collector
//  	performance varies with object lifetimes.  It prints the time
//  	required to allocate and collect balanced binary trees of various
//  	sizes.  Smaller trees result in shorter object lifetimes.  Each cycle
//  	allocates roughly the same amount of memory.
//  	Two data structures are kept around during the entire process, so
//  	that the measured performance is representative of applications
//  	that maintain some live in-memory data.  One of these is a tree
//  	containing many pointers.  The other is a large array containing
//  	double precision floating point numbers.  Both should be of comparable
//  	size.
//
//  	The results are only really meaningful together with a specification
//  	of how much memory was used.  It is possible to trade memory for
//  	better time performance.  This benchmark should be run in a 32 MB
//  	heap, though we don't currently know how to enforce that uniformly.
//
//  	Unlike the original Ellis and Kovac benchmark, we do not attempt
//   	measure pause times.  This facility should eventually be added back
//  	in.  There are several reasons for omitting it for now.  The original
//  	implementation depended on assumptions about the thread scheduler
//  	that don't hold uniformly.  The results really measure both the
//  	scheduler and GC.  Pause time measurements tend to not fit well with
//  	current benchmark suites.  As far as we know, none of the current
//  	commercial Java implementations seriously attempt to minimize GC pause
//  	times.
