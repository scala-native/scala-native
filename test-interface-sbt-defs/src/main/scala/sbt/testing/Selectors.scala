/** Information in addition to a test class name that identifies the suite or

 *
 *  - <code>SuiteSelector</code> - indicates an event is about an entire suite
 *    of tests whose class was reported as <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> in
 *    the <code>Event</code>
 *  - <code>TestSelector</code> - indicates an event is about a single test
 *    directly contained in the suite whose class was reported as
 *    <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> in the <code>Event</code>
 *  - <code>NestedSuiteSelector</code> - indicates an event is about an entire
 *    nested suite of tests whose top-level, "nesting" class was reported as
 *    <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> in the <code>Event</code>
 *  - <code>NestedTestSelector</code> - indicates an event is about a single
 *    test contained in a nested suite whose top-level, "nesting" class was
 *    reported as <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> in the <code>Event</code>
 *  - <code>TestWildcardSelector</code> - indicates an event is about zero to
 *    many tests directly contained in the suite whose class was reported as
 *    <code>fullyQualifiedName</code> in the <code>Event</code>
