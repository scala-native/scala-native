/** A bundle of information used to request a <code>Task</code> from a test
 *  framework.
 *
 *  An array of <code>TaskDef</code> is passed to
 *  <a href="Runner.html"><code>Runner</code></a>'s <code>tasks</code> method,
 *  which returns an array of <code>Tasks</code>.  Each returned task, when
 *  executed, will run tests and suites determined by the test class name,
 *  fingerprints, "explicitly specified" field, and selectors of one of the
 *  passed <code>TaskDef</code>s.
 *
 *  The "Explicitly specified" field means the user supplied a complete fully
 *  qualified test name, such as with the command:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  &gt; test-only com.mycompany.myproject.WholeNameSpec
 *  }}}
 *
 *  as opposed to commands like:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  &gt; test-only *WholeNameSpec
 *  }}}
 *
 *  or simply:
 *
 *  {{{
 *  &gt; test
 *  }}}
 *
 *  The <code>explicitlySpecified</code> field will be true for in the first
 *  case, and false in the last two cases, because only in the first case was
 *  the fully qualified test class name completely specified by the user. The
 *  test framework can use this information to decide whether to ignore an
 *  annotation requesting a class not be discovered.
 *
 *  The <code>fingerprint</code> parameter indicates how the test suite was
 *  identified as a test suite. This <code>tasks</code> method may be called
 *  with <code>TaskDef</code>s containing the same value for
 *  <code>testClassName</code> but different fingerprints. For example, if both
 *  a class and its companion object were test classes, the <code>tasks</code>
 *  method could be passed an array containing <code>TaskDef</code>s with the
 *  same name but with a different value for <code>fingerprint.isModule</code>.
 *
 *  A test framework may "reject" a requested task by returning no
 *  <code>Task</code> for that <code>TaskDef</code>.
 *
 *  @param fullyQualifiedName the fully qualified name of the test class to be
 *            run by the requested task
 *  @param fingerprint indicates how the test suite was identified as a test
 *            suite
 *  @param explicitlySpecified indicates whether the test class was explicitly
 *            specified by user.
 *  @param selectors a possibly empty array of <code>Selectors</code>
 *            determining suites and tests to run
