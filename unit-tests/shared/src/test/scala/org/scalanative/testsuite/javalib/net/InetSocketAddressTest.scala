    /* This section explains deleted lines, so that somebody does not restore
     * them.
     *
     * InetSocketAddress calls InetAddress with a numeric argument to
     * create an underlying InetAddress. The InetAddress so created will have
     * a null host. There is no attempt to resolve the hostname.
     * The address.toString test is correct in expecting a empty_string
     * hostname (left of the slash).
     *
     * 'address.getHostName'will attempt to resolve the hostname if it has not
     * been resolved before. Recall that at creation the hostname was not
     * resolved.
     *
     * Almost all systems the IPv4 loopback address will resolve to
     * "localhost". Only a tiny minority of systems are configured otherwise.
     * This makes the test below chancy at best and better called invalid.
     *
     *   val localhostName = address.getHostName
     *   assertFalse(localhostName == null)
     *   assertEquals(localhostName + "/127.0.0.1:0", address.toString)
     *
     * The bug is that this test ever passed in the wild.
