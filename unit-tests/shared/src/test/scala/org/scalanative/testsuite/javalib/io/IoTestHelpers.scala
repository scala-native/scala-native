/* Note on Technical Debt:
 *
 * The good news about Technical Debt is that it means that a project has
 * endured long enough to accumulate it.  The bad news is that there
 * is accumulated Technical Debt.
 *
 * Specifically, the "withTemporaryDirectory" concept and implementations of it
 * and close kin, exist in a number of places) in javalib unit-tests.
 * They tend to have slight variations, which make both development &
 * maintenance both annoying and error prone.
 * Someday they should be unified into a "Single Point of Truth".
 *
 * This file allows the FileInputStream#available test introduced in PR 3333
 * to share the "withTemporaryDirectory" previously used in FileOutputStream.
 * By doing so, it avoids introducing new Technical Debt. It makes no attempt
 * to solve the whole "withTemporaryDirectory" problem.
 *
 * The impediment to solving the larger problem is probably determining a
 * proper place in the directory tree for the common file and gaining
 * consensus.
 *
 * Perhaps inspiration or enlightenment will strike the next time someone
 * implements or maintains a unit-test requiring "withTemporaryDirectory".
