/** Core RPC dispatcher.
 *
 *  Tracks and assigns call identities on top of a message passing interface.
 *
 *  Note that it does not have timeout handling for calls. Users are expected to
 *  manage call teardown by calling [[close]] in case of failure. This typically
 *  means that subclasses need to put an explicit call to [[close]] once they
 *  are sure to not call [[handleMessage]] anymore.
 *
 *  This class guarantees that dispatch handles synchronously when
 *  [[handleMessage]] is called, so closing can be performed race-free.
