IDE setup
=========

Metals
------
Metals import should work out of the box for most of the modules, it's the recommended IDE.  
To speed up indexing and prevent Bloop-related issues by default we export only 1 version of ``MultiScalaProject``, otherwise it would need to cross-compile sources for all binary Scala versions on each source-change.
By default IDE would target Scala 3 projects, to change this behavior modify ``project/MyScalaNativePlugin.scala`` and modify ``ideScalaVersion``. This change would be only required when developing Scala 2 compiler plugins, sbt plugins or Scala 2 specific sources.


IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

* Select "Create project from existing sources" and choose the ``build.sbt`` file. When prompted, select "Open as project". Make sure you select the "Use sbt shell" for both import and build.

* When the import is complete, we need to fix some module dependencies:

  * ``scalalib``: Right-click on the module, "Mark directory as" -> "Excluded". This is needed because ``scalalib`` is only meant to be used at runtime (it is the Scala library that the executables link against). Not excluding it makes IDEA think that the Scala library comes from it, which results into highlighting errors.
  * ``nscplugin``: We need to add what SBT calls ``unmanagedSourceDirectories`` as dependencies. Go go Project Structure -> Modules -> ``nscplugin`` -> Dependencies and click the + icon. Select "JARs or Directories" and navigate to the ``nir`` directory at the root of the Scala Native project. Repeat for the ``util`` directory.
  * ``native-build``: We need to add the ``sbt-scala-native`` module as a dependency. Go go Project Structure -> Modules -> ``native-build`` -> Dependencies and click the + icon. Select "Module Dependency" and select the ``sbt-scala-native`` module.

The above is not an exhaustive list, but it is the bare minimum to have the build working. Please keep in mind that you will have to repeat the above steps, in case you reload (re-import) the SBT build. This will need to happen if you change some SBT-related file (e.g. ``build.sbt``).

Setup for clangd
----------------

`clangd` is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) for C and C++. Your IDE of choice can connect to `clangd` to help development using C and C++.

* VSCode: Add the `clangd` extension from LLVM. Full documentation for `clangd` is `here <https://clangd.llvm.org>`_. You can also add the C/C++ extensions
  from Microsoft if desired for highlighting and other features.

A `compile_flags.txt` is needed to get the best setup to work on `nativelib` and the Garbage Collectors. Since we use conditional compilation for
garbage collection selection and the code is in a `gc` directory we need an include for the header relative paths and defines for the different garbage
collectors we have in the project. `clangd` works well as a default but only has defines for your platform and can only work out of the box for
certain simple setups which is probably fine for most other projects. The following is an example file that should be put in the
`nativelib/src/main/resources/scala-native` directory. Change the first include path for your platform.
