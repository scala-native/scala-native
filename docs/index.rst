Scala Native
============

Scala Native is an optimizing ahead-of-time compiler and lightweight managed
runtime designed specifically for Scala. It features:

* **Low-level primitives**.

  .. code-block:: scala

      type Vec = CStruct3[Double, Double, Double]

      val vec = stackalloc[Vec] // allocate c struct on stack
      vec._1 = 10.0             // initialize fields
      vec._2 = 20.0
      vec._3 = 30.0
      length(vec)               // pass by reference

  Pointers, structs, you name it. Low-level primitives
  let you hand-tune your application to make it work
  exactly as you want it to. You're in control.

* **Seamless interop with native code**.

  .. code-block:: scala

      @extern object stdlib {
        def malloc(size: CSize): Ptr[Byte] = extern
      }

      val ptr = stdlib.malloc(32)

  Calling C code has never been easier.
  With the help of extern objects you can
  seamlessly call native code without any
  runtime overhead.

* **Instant startup time**.

  .. code-block:: text

      > time hello-native
      hello, native!

      real    0m0.005s
      user    0m0.002s
      sys     0m0.002s

  Scala Native is compiled ahead-of-time via LLVM.
  This means that there is no sluggish warm-up
  phase that's common for just-in-time compilers.
  Your code is immediately fast and ready for action.
