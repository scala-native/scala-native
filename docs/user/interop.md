# Native code interoperability

Scala Native provides an interop layer that makes it easy to interact
with foreign native code. This includes C and other languages that can
expose APIs via C ABI (e.g. C++, D, Rust etc.)

All of the interop APIs discussed here are defined in
`scala.scalanative.unsafe` package. For brevity, we\'re going to refer
to that namespace as just `unsafe`.

## Extern objects

Extern objects are simple wrapper objects that demarcate scopes where
methods are treated as their native C ABI-friendly counterparts. They
are roughly analogous to header files with top-level function
declarations in C.

For example, to call C\'s `malloc` one might declare it as following:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

@extern
object libc {
  def malloc(size: CSize): Ptr[Byte] = extern
}
```

`extern` on the right hand side of the method definition signifies that
the body of the method is defined elsewhere in a native library that is
available on the library path (see [Linking with native
libraries](#linking-with-native-libraries)). The signature of the
external function must match the signature of the original C function
(see [Finding the right signature](#finding-the-right-signature)).

### Finding the right signature

To find a correct signature for a given C function one must provide an
equivalent Scala type for each of the arguments:

  C Type                    Scala Type
  ------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------
  `void`                    `Unit`
  `bool`                    `unsafe.CBool`
  `char`                    `unsafe.CChar`
  `signed char`             `unsafe.CSignedChar`
  `unsigned char`           `unsafe.CUnsignedChar`[^1]
  `short`                   `unsafe.CShort`
  `unsigned short`          `unsafe.CUnsignedShort`[^2]
  `int`                     `unsafe.CInt`
  `long int`                `unsafe.CLongInt`
  `unsigned int`            `unsafe.CUnsignedInt`[^3]
  `unsigned long int`       `unsafe.CUnsignedLongInt`[^4]
  `long`                    `unsafe.CLong`
  `unsigned long`           `unsafe.CUnsignedLong`[^5]
  `long long`               `unsafe.CLongLong`
  `unsigned long long`      `unsafe.CUnsignedLongLong`[^6]
  `size_t`                  `unsafe.CSize`
  `ssize_t`                 `unsafe.CSSize`
  `ptrdiff_t`               `unsafe.CPtrDiff`[^7]
  `wchar_t`                 `unsafe.CWideChar`
  `char16_t`                `unsafe.CChar16`
  `char32_t`                `unsafe.CChar32`
  `float`                   `unsafe.CFloat`
  `double`                  `unsafe.CDouble`
  `void*`                   `unsafe.CVoidPtr`[^8]
  `int*`                    `unsafe.Ptr[unsafe.CInt]`[^9]
  `char*`                   `unsafe.CString`[^10][^11]
  `int (*)(int)`            `unsafe.CFuncPtr1[unsafe.CInt, unsafe.CInt]`[^12][^13]
  `struct { int x, y; }*`   `unsafe.Ptr[unsafe.CStruct2[unsafe.CInt, unsafe.CInt]]`[^14][^15]
  `struct { int x, y; }`    Not supported

### Linking with native libraries

C compilers typically require to pass an additional `-l mylib` flag to
dynamically link with a library. In Scala Native, one can annotate
libraries to link with using the `@link` annotation.

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

@link("mylib")
@extern
object mylib {
  def f(): Unit = extern
}
```

Whenever any of the members of `mylib` object are reachable, the Scala
Native linker will automatically link with the corresponding native
library.

As in C, library names are specified without the `lib` prefix. For
example, the library [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv) corresponds
to `@link("uv")` in Scala Native.

It is possible to rename functions using the `@name` annotation. Its use
is recommended to enforce the Scala naming conventions in bindings:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

@link("uv")
@extern
object uv {
  @name("uv_uptime")
  def uptime(result: Ptr[CDouble]): Int = extern
}
```

If a library has multiple components, you could split the bindings into
separate objects as it is permitted to use the same `@link` annotation
more than once.

### Variadic functions

Scala Native supports native interoperability with C\'s variadic
argument list type (i.e. `va_list`), and partially for `...` varargs.
For example `vprintf` and `printf` defined in C as:

``` C
int vprintf(const char * format, va_list arg);
int printf(const char * format, ... );  
```

can be declared in Scala as:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

@extern
object mystdio {
  def vprintf(format: CString, args: CVarArgList): CInt = extern
  def printf(format: CString, args: Any*): CInt = extern
}
```

The limitation of `...` interop requires that it\'s
arguments needs to passed directly to variadic arguments function or
arguments need to be inlined. This is required to obtain enough
information on how arguments show be passed in regards to C ABI. Passing
a sequence to extern method variadic arguments is not allowed and would
result in compilation failure.

For `va_list` interop, one can wrap a function in a nicer API like:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

def myprintf(format: CString, args: CVarArg*): CInt =
  Zone { 
    mystdio.vprintf(format, toCVarArgList(args.toSeq))
  }
```

See [Memory management](#memory-management) for a guide of using
`unsafe.Zone` And then call it just like a regular Scala function:

``` scala
myprintf(c"2 + 3 = %d, 4 + 5 = %d", 2 + 3, 4 + 5)
printf(c"2 + 3 = %d, 4 + 5 = %d", 2 + 3, 4 + 5)
```

## Exported methods

When linking Scala Native as library, you can mark functions that should
visible in created library with `@exported(name: String)` annotation. In
case if you omit or use null as the argument for name extern function
name match the name of the method. Currently, only static object methods
can be exported. To export accessors of field or variable in static
object use `@exportAccessors(getterName: String, setterName: String)`.
If you omit the explicit names in the annotation constructor, Scala
Native would create exported methods with `set_` and `get_` prefixes and
name of field.

`int ScalaNativeInit(void);` function is special exported
function that needs to be called before invoking any code defined in
Scala Native. It returns `0` on successful initialization
and non-zero value in the otherwise. For dynamic libraries a constructor
would be generated to invoke `ScalaNativeInit`[ function
automatically upon loading library or startup of the program. If for
some reason you need to disable automatic initialization of Scala Native
upon loading dynamic library and invoke it manually in user code set
\`SCALANATIVE_NO_DYLIB_CTOR]{.title-ref} environment variable. You can
also disable generation of library constructors by defining
`-DSCALANATIVE_NO_DYLIB_CTOR` in
NativeConfig::compileOptions of your build.

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe._

object myLib{
  @exportAccessors("mylib_current_count", "mylib_set_counter")
  var counter: Int = 0

  @exportAccessors("error_message")
  val ErrorMessage: CString = c"Something bad just happend!"

  @exported
  def addLongs(l: Long, r: Long): Long = l + r

  @exported("mylib_addInts")
  def addInts(l: Int, r: Int): Int = l + r
}
```

``` c
// libmylib.h
int ScalaNativeInit(void);
long addLongs(long, long);
int mylib_addInts(int, int);
int mylib_current_count();
void mylib_set_counter(int);

// test.c
#include "libmylib.h"
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
  // This function needs to be called before invoking any methods defined in Scala Native.
  // Might be called automatically unless SCALANATIVE_NO_DYLIB_CTOR env variable is set.
  assert(ScalaNativeInit() == 0);
  addLongs(0L, 4L);
  mylib_addInts(4, 0);
  printf("Current count %d\n", mylib_current_count());
  mylib_set_counter(42);
  // ...
}
```

## Pointer types

Scala Native provides a built-in equivalent of C\'s pointers via
`unsafe.Ptr[T]` data type. Under the hood pointers are implemented using
unmanaged machine pointers.

Operations on pointers are closely related to their C counterparts and
are compiled into equivalent machine code:

  Operation          C syntax               Scala Syntax
  ------------------ ---------------------- ------------------
  Load value         `*ptr`                 `!ptr`
  Store value        `*ptr = value`         `!ptr = value`
  Pointer to index   `ptr + i`, `&ptr[i]`   `ptr + i`
  Elements between   `ptr1 - ptr2`          `ptr1 - ptr2`
  Load at index      `ptr[i]`               `ptr(i)`
  Store at index     `ptr[i] = value`       `ptr(i) = value`
  Pointer to field   `&ptr->name`           `ptr.atN`
  Load a field       `ptr->name`            `ptr._N`
  Store a field      `ptr->name = value`    `ptr._N = value`

Where `N` is the index of the field `name` in the struct. See [Memory
layout types](#memory-layout-types) for details.

### Function pointers

It is possible to use external functions that take function pointers.
For example given the following signature in C:

``` C
void test(void (* f)(char *));
```

One can declare it as follows in Scala Native:

``` scala
def test(f: unsafe.CFuncPtr1[CString, Unit]): Unit = unsafe.extern
```

`CFuncPtrN` types are final classes containing pointer to
underlying C function pointer. They automatically handle boxing call
arguments and unboxing result. You can create them from C pointer using
`CFuncPtr` helper methods:

``` scala
def fnDef(str: CString): CInt = ???

val anyPtr: CVoidPtr = CFuncPtr.toPtr {
  CFuncPtr1.fromScalaFunction(fnDef)
}

type StringLengthFn = CFuncPtr1[CString, CInt]
val func: StringLengthFn = CFuncPtr.fromPtr[StringLengthFn](anyPtr)
func(c"hello")
```

It\'s also possible to create `CFuncPtrN` from Scala
`FunctionN`. You can do this by using implicit method
conversion method from the corresponding companion object.

``` scala
import scalanative.unsafe.CFuncPtr0
def myFunc(): Unit = println("hi there!")

val myFuncPtr: CFuncPtr0[Unit] = CFuncPtr0.fromScalaFunction(myFunc)
val myImplFn: CFuncPtr0[Unit] = myFunc _
val myLambdaFuncPtr: CFuncPtr0[Unit] = () => println("hello!")
```

On Scala 2.12 or newer, the Scala language automatically converts from
closures to SAM types:

``` scala
val myfuncptr: unsafe.CFuncPtr0[Unit] = () => println("hi there!")
```

### Memory management

Unlike standard Scala objects that are managed automatically by the
underlying runtime system, one has to be extra careful when working with
unmanaged memory.

1.  **Zone allocation.** (since 0.3)

    > Zones (also known as memory regions/contexts) are a technique for
    > semi-automatic memory management. Using them one can bind
    > allocations to a temporary scope in the program and the zone
    > allocator will automatically clean them up for you as soon as
    > execution goes out of it:
    >
    > ``` scala
    > import scala.scalanative.unsafe._
    >
    > // For Scala 3
    > Zone {
    >   val buffer = alloc[Byte](n)
    > }
    > // For Scala 2, works, but is not idiomatic on Scala 3
    > Zone.acquire { implicit z =>
    >   val buffer = alloc[Byte](n)
    > }
    > ```

    `alloc` requests memory sufficient to contain `n` values
    of a given type. If number of elements is not specified, it defaults
    to a single element. Memory is zeroed out by default.

    Zone allocation is the preferred way to allocate temporary unmanaged
    memory. It\'s idiomatic to use implicit zone parameters to abstract
    over code that has to zone allocate.

    One typical example of this are C strings that are created from
    Scala strings using `unsafe.toCString`. The conversion takes
    implicit zone parameter and allocates the result in that zone.

    When using zone allocated memory one has to be careful not to
    capture this memory beyond the lifetime of the zone. Dereferencing
    zone-allocated memory after the end of the zone is undefined
    behavior.

2.  **Stack allocation.**

    > Scala Native provides a built-in way to perform stack allocations
    > of using `unsafe.stackalloc` function:
    >
    > ``` scala
    > val buffer = unsafe.stackalloc[Byte](256)
    > ```
    >
    > This code will allocate 256 bytes that are going to be available
    > until the enclosing method returns. Number of elements to be
    > allocated is optional and defaults to 1 otherwise. Memory **is
    > zeroed out** by default.
    >
    > When using stack allocated memory one has to be careful not to
    > capture this memory beyond the lifetime of the method.
    > Dereferencing stack allocated memory after the method\'s execution
    > has completed is undefined behavior.

3.  **Manual heap allocation.**

    > Scala Native\'s library contains a bindings for a subset of the
    > standard libc functionality. This includes the trio of `malloc`,
    > `realloc` and `free` functions that are defined in `unsafe.stdlib`
    > extern object.
    >
    > Calling those will let you allocate memory using system\'s
    > standard dynamic memory allocator. Every single manual allocation
    > must also be freed manually as soon as it\'s not needed any
    > longer.
    >
    > Apart from the standard system allocator one might also bind to
    > plethora of 3-rd party allocators such as
    > [jemalloc](http://jemalloc.net/) to serve the same purpose.

### Undefined behavior

Similarly to their C counter-parts, behavior of operations that access
memory is subject to undefined behaviour for following conditions:

1.  Dereferencing null.
2.  Out-of-bounds memory access.
3.  Use-after-free.
4.  Use-after-return.
5.  Double-free, invalid free.

### Memory layout types

Memory layout types are auxiliary types that let one specify memory
layout of unmanaged memory. They are meant to be used purely in
combination with native pointers and do not have a corresponding
first-class values backing them.

-   `unsafe.Ptr[unsafe.CStructN[T1, ..., TN]]`

    Pointer to a C struct with up to 22 fields. Type parameters are the
    types of corresponding fields. One may access fields of the struct
    using `_N` helper methods on a pointer value:

    ``` scala
    val ptr = unsafe.stackalloc[unsafe.CStruct2[Int, Int]]()
    ptr._1 = 10
    ptr._2 = 20
    println(s"first ${ptr._1}, second ${ptr._2}")
    ```

    Here `_N` is an accessor for the field number N.

-   `unsafe.Ptr[unsafe.CArray[T, N]]`

    Pointer to a C array with statically-known length `N`. Length is
    encoded as a type-level natural number. Natural numbers are types
    that are composed of base naturals `Nat._0, ... Nat._9` and an
    additional `Nat.DigitN` constructors, where `N` refers to number of
    digits in the given number. So for example number `1024` is going to
    be encoded as following:

        import scalanative.unsafe._, Nat._

        type _1024 = Digit4[_1, _0, _2, _4]

    Once you have a natural for the length, it can be used as an array
    length:

        val arrptr = unsafe.stackalloc[CArray[Byte, _1024]]()

    You can find an address of n-th array element via `arrptr.at(n)`.

### Byte strings

Scala Native supports byte strings via `c"..."` string interpolator that
gets compiled down to pointers to statically-allocated zero-terminated
strings (similarly to C):

``` scala
import scalanative.unsafe._
import scalanative.libc._

// CString is an alias for Ptr[CChar]
val msg: CString = c"Hello, world!"
stdio.printf(msg)
```

It does not allow any octal values or escape characters not supported by
Scala compiler, like `\a` or `\?`, but also unicode escapes. It is
possible to use C-style hex values up to value 0xFF, eg.
`c"Hello \x61\x62\x63"`

Additionally, we also expose two helper functions `unsafe.fromCString`
and `unsafe.toCString` to convert between C-style `CString`
(sequence of Bytes, usually interpreted as UTF-8 or ASCII) and
Java-style `String` (sequence of 2-byte Chars usually
interpreted as UTF-16).

It\'s worth to remember that `unsafe.toCString` and
`c\"\...\"` interpreter cannot be used interchangeably as
they handle literals differently. Helper methods
`` unsafe.fromCString` and ``unsafe.toCString`` are charset aware. They will always assume `String` is UTF-16, and take a `Charset` parameter to know what encoding to assume for the byte string (`CString`) - if not present it is UTF-8.  If passed a null as an argument, they will return a null of the appropriate type instead of throwing a NullPointerException.   Platform-specific types -----------------------  Scala Native defines the type ``Size`and its unsigned counterpart,`USize`. A size corresponds to`Int`on 32-bit architectures and to`Long`on 64-bit ones.  Size and alignment of types ---------------------------  In order to statically determine the size of a type, you can use the`sizeof`function which is Scala Native's counterpart of the eponymous C operator. It returns the size in bytes:  .. code-block:: scala      println(unsafe.sizeof[Byte])    // 1     println(unsafe.sizeof[CBool])   // 1     println(unsafe.sizeof[CShort])  // 2     println(unsafe.sizeof[CInt])    // 4     println(unsafe.sizeof[CLong])   // 8  It can also be used to obtain the size of a structure:  .. code-block:: scala      type TwoBytes = unsafe.CStruct2[Byte, Byte]     println(unsafe.sizeof[TwoBytes])  // 2  Additionally, you can also use`alignmentof`to find the alignment of a given type:  .. code-block:: scala      println(unsafe.alignmentof[Int])                         // 4     println(unsafe.alignmentof[unsafe.CStruct2[Byte, Long]]) // 8  Unsigned integer types ----------------------  Scala Native provides support for four unsigned integer types:  1.`unsigned.UByte`2.`unsigned.UShort`3.`unsigned.UInt`4.`unsigned.ULong`5.`unsigned.USize`They share the same primitive operations as signed integer types. Primitive operation between two integer values are supported only if they have the same signedness (they must both signed or both unsigned.)  Conversions between signed and unsigned integers must be done explicitly using`byteValue.toUByte`,`shortValue.toUShort`,`intValue.toUInt`,`longValue.toULong`,`sizeValue.toUSize`and conversely`unsignedByteValue.toByte`,`unsignedShortValue.toShort`,`unsignedIntValue.toInt`,`unsignedLongValue.toLong`,`unsignedSizeValue.toSize`.  Universal equality is supported between signed and unsigned integers, for example`-1.toUByte
== 255`or`65535 ==
-1.toUShort`would yield`true`` ,  However, similar to signed integers on JVM, class equality between different (boxed) integer types is not supported. Usage of `-1.toUByte.equals(255)` would return ``false`, as we're comparing different boxed types (`scala.scalanative.unsigned.UByte`with`java.lang.Integer\`\`)
