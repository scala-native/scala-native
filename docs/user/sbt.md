# Building projects with sbt

If you have reached this section you probably have a system that is now
able to compile and run Scala Native programs.

## Minimal sbt project

The easiest way to make a fresh project is to use our official gitter8
template. In an empty working directory, execute:

    sbt new scala-native/scala-native.g8

*Note:*
On Windows, new project should not be created in `mounted`
directories, like external storage devices.
In the case of WSL2 (Windows Subsystem Linux), Windows file system
drives like `C` or `D` are perceived as
`mounted`. So creating new projects in these locations will
not work.
In the WSL2 environment, it is recommended to create projects in the
user files path, e.g /home/\<USER\>/sn-projects.


This will:

-   start sbt.
-   prompt for a project name
-   use the [.g8
    template](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native.g8/tree/main/src/main/g8).
    to generate a basic project with that name.
-   create a project sub-directory with the project name.
-   copy the contents at these template links to the corresponding
    location in this new project sub-directory.
    -   [project/plugins.sbt](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native.g8/blob/main/src/main/g8/project/plugins.sbt)
        adds the Scala Native plugin dependency and its version.
    -   [project/build.properties](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native.g8/blob/main/src/main/g8/project/build.properties)
        specifies the sbt version.
    -   [build.sbt](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native.g8/blob/main/src/main/g8/build.sbt)
        enables the plugin and specifies the Scala version.
    -   [src/main/scala/Main.scala](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native.g8/blob/main/src/main/g8/src/main/scala/Main.scala)
        is a minimal application. :
            object Main {
              def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
                println("Hello, world!")
            }

To use the new project:

-   Change the current working directory to the new project directory.
    > -   For example, on linux with a project named
    >     AnswerToProjectNamePrompt, type
    >     `cd AnswerToProjectNamePrompt`.

-   Type `sbt run`.

This will get everything compiled and should have the expected output!

Please refer to the [faq](../faq.md) if you encounter
any problems.

The generated project is a starting point. After the first run, you
should review the software versions in the generated files and,
possibly, update or customize them.
[Scaladex](https://index.scala-lang.org/) is a useful resource for
software versions.


## Sbt settings and tasks

Use `nativeConfig` in `sbt` to provide settings. This is
often done in a project\'s `build.sbt`.

**Warning**: If you change settings you should clean your project to
remove generated code to be safe.

Scala Native starts execution with a NativeConfig object, called
nativeConfig, filled with default values:

    show ThisBuild / nativeConfig

Each `withX()` method creates a new NativeConfig with the indicated `X`
value set. All other settings are taken from the Config object being
accessed.

To show nativeConfig values active in current scope at any point in
time:

> sbt\> show nativeConfig

To set a new value and replace any previous setting:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.build._

nativeConfig ~= {
  _.withLTO(LTO.thin)
    .withMode(Mode.releaseFast)
    .withGC(GC.commix)
}
```

To append a value to the right of any previous setting:

``` scala
import scala.scalanative.build._

// Enable verbose reporting during compilation
nativeConfig ~= { c =>
  c.withCompileOptions(_ :+ "-v")
}

// Use an alternate linker
nativeConfig ~= { c =>
  c.withLinkingOptions(c.linkingOptions ++ Seq("-fuse-ld=mold"))
}

/* The keen observer will note that "-fuse-ld=mold" could also have been
 *  set using "withCompileOptions". 
 */
```

    details.

## Compilation modes

Scala Native supports three distinct linking modes:

1.  **debug.** (default)

    Default mode. Optimized for shortest compilation time. Runs fewer
    optimizations and is much more suited for iterative development
    workflow. Similar to clang\'s `-O0`.

2.  **release.** (deprecated since 0.4.0)

    Aliases to **release-full**.

3.  **release-fast.** (introduced in 0.4.0)

    Optimize for runtime performance while still trying to keep quick
    compilation time and small emitted code size. Similar to clang\'s
    `-O2` with addition of link-time optimization over the whole
    application code.

4.  **release-size.** (introduced in 0.5.0)

    Optimize for reduced output size while still trying to keep quick
    compilation time and relatively fast runtime performance. Similar to
    clang\'s `-Oz` with addition of link-time optimization over the
    whole application code.

5.  **release-full.** (introduced in 0.4.0)

    Optimized for best runtime performance, even if hurts compilation
    time and code size. This modes includes a number of more aggresive
    optimizations such type-driven method duplication and more aggresive
    inliner. Similar to clang\'s `-O3` with addition of link-time
    optimization over the whole application code.

## Garbage collectors

1.  **immix.** (default since 0.3.8, introduced in 0.3)

    Immix is a mostly-precise mark-region tracing garbage collector.
    More information about the collector is available as part of the
    original [0.3.0
    announcement](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/releases/tag/v0.3.0).

2.  **commix.** (introduced in 0.4)

    Commix is parallel mark and concurrent sweep garbage collector based
    on Immix

3.  **boehm.** (default through 0.3.7)

    Conservative generational garbage collector. More information is
    available at the Github project \"ivmai/bdgc\" page.

4.  **none.** (experimental, introduced in 0.2)

    Garbage collector that allocates things without ever freeing them.
    Useful for short-running command-line applications or applications
    where garbage collections pauses are not acceptable.

## Link-Time Optimization (LTO)

Scala Native relies on link-time optimization to maximize runtime
performance of release builds. There are three possible modes that are
currently supported:

1.  **none.** (default)

    Does not inline across Scala/C boundary. Scala to Scala calls are
    still optimized.

2.  **full.** (available on Clang 3.8 or older)

    Inlines across Scala/C boundary using legacy FullLTO mode.

3.  **thin.** (recommended on Clang 3.9 or newer)

    Inlines across Scala/C boundary using LLVM\'s latest [ThinLTO
    mode](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThinLTO.html). Offers both better
    compilation speed and better runtime performance of the generated
    code than the legacy FullLTO mode.

## Cross compilation using target triple

The target triple can be set to allow cross compilation (introduced in
0.4.0). Use the following approach in `sbt` to set the
target triple:

``` scala
nativeConfig ~= { _.withTargetTriple("x86_64-apple-macosx10.14.0") }
```

you may create a few dedicated projects with different target triples.
If you have multiple project definitions for different macOS
architectures, eg:

``` scala
lazy val sandbox64 = project.in(file("sandbox"))
    .settings(nativeConfig ~= { _.withTargetTriple("arm64-apple-darwin20.6.0") })

lazy val sandboxM1 = project.in(file("sandbox"))
    .settings(nativeConfig ~= { _.withTargetTriple("x86_64-apple-darwin20.6.0") })
```

These project definitions allow to produce different binaries - one
dedicated for the `x86_64` platform and another one for
`arm64`. You may easily combine them to one so called fat
binary or universal binary via lipo:

``` sh
lipo -create sandbox64/target/scala-2.12/sandbox64-out sandboxM1/target/scala-2.12/sandboxM1-out -output sandbox-out
```

which produces `sandbox-out` that can be used at any
platform.

You may use [`FatELF](https://icculus.org/fatelf/) to build
fat binaries for Linux.

## Build target

Setting build target allows you to specify to what type of object your
project should be linked to. As an example, to link it as dynamic
library use the following command:

``` scala
nativeConfig ~= { _.withBuildTarget(BuildTarget.libraryDynamic) }
```

1.  **application** (default)

    Results in creating ready to use executable program.

2.  **libraryDynamic**

    Results in dynamic library being built based on entry point methods
    annotated with `\@exported`, for details see
    [interop](./interop.md).

3.  **libraryStatic**

    > Results in building static library using the same semantincs as in
    > the libraryDynamic. Exported methods should handle exceptions, as
    > they might not be able to be catched in the program using static
    > library. Building static library requires LLVM 14 or newer.

## Publishing

Scala Native supports sbt\'s standard workflow for the package
distribution:

1.  Compile your code.
2.  Generate a jar with all of the class files and NIR files.
3.  Publish the jar to
    [sonatype](https://github.com/xerial/sbt-sonatype),
    [bintray](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-bintray) or any other 3rd party
    hosting service.

Once the jar has been published, it can be resolved through sbt\'s
standard package resolution system.

## Cross compilation

[sbt-crossproject](https://github.com/portable-scala/sbt-crossproject)
is an sbt plugin that lets you cross-compile your projects against all
three major platforms in Scala: JVM, JavaScript via Scala.js, and native
via Scala Native. It is based on the original cross-project idea from
Scala.js and supports the same syntax for existing JVM/JavaScript
cross-projects. Please refer to the project\'s
[README](https://github.com/portable-scala/sbt-crossproject/blob/master/README.md)
for details.

Continue to [lang](./lang.md).
