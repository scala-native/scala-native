Building projects with sbt
==========================

If you have reached this section you probably have a system that is now able to compile and run Scala Native programs.

Minimal sbt project
-------------------

The easiest way to make a fresh project is to use our official gitter8 template::

    sbt new scala-native/scala-native.g8

This includes:

* ``project/plugins.sbt`` to add a plugin dependency::

    addSbtPlugin("org.scala-native" % "sbt-scala-native" % "0.3.0")

* ``project/build.properties`` to specify the sbt version::

    sbt.version = 0.13.15

* ``build.sbt`` to enable the plugin and specify Scala version::

    enablePlugins(ScalaNativePlugin)

    scalaVersion := "2.11.11"

* ``src/main/scala/Main.scala`` with minimal application::

    object Main {
      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
        println("Hello, world!")
    }

Now, simply run ``sbt run`` to get everything compiled and have the expected
output! Please refer to the :ref:`faq` if you encounter any problems.

Scala versions
--------------

Scala Native supports following Scala versions for corresponding releases:

==================== ================
Scala Native Version Scala Versions

0.1.x                2.11.8
0.2.x                2.11.8, 2.11.11
0.3.x                2.11.8, 2.11.11

2. See `Compilation modes`_ for details.
3. See `Garbage collectors`_ for details.

Compilation modes
-----------------

Scala Native supports two distinct linking modes:

1. **debug.** (default)

   Default mode. Optimized for shortest compilation time. Runs fewer
   optimizations and is much more suited for iterative development workflow.
   Similar to clang's ``-O0``.

2. **release.**

   Optimized for best runtime performance at expense of longer compilation time.
   Similar to clang's ``-O2`` with addition of link-time optimization over
   the whole application code.

Garbage collectors
------------------

1. **boehm.** (default)

   Conservative generational garbage collector. More information is available
   at the `project's page <https://www.hboehm.info/gc/>`_.

2. **none.** (experimental, since 0.2)

   Garbage collector that allocates things without ever freeing them. Useful
   for short-running command-line applications or applications where garbage
   collections pauses are not acceptable.

3. **immix.** (experimental, since 0.3)

   Immix is a mostly-precise mark-region tracing garbage collector.
   More information about the collector is available as part of the original
   `0.3.0 announcement <https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/releases/tag/v0.3.0>`_.

Publishing
----------

Scala Native supports sbt's standard workflow for the package distribution:

1. Compile your code.
2. Generate a jar with all of the class files and NIR files.
3. Publish the jar to `sonatype`_, `bintray`_ or any other 3rd party hosting service.

Once the jar has been published, it can be resolved through sbt's standard
package resolution system.

Cross compilation
-----------------

`sbt-crossproject <https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject>`_ is an
sbt plugin that lets you cross-compile your projects against all three major
platforms in Scala: JVM, JavaScript via Scala.js, and native via Scala Native.
It is based on the original cross-project idea from Scala.js and supports the
same syntax for existing JVM/JavaScript cross-projects. Please refer to the
project's
`README <https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject/blob/master/README.md>`_
for details.
