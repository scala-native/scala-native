Building projects with SBT
==========================

If you have reached this section you probably have a system that is now able to compile and run Scala Native programs.

Minimal sbt project
-------------------

Start within a new folder, and create a file ``project/plugins.sbt`` as follows::

    addSbtPlugin("org.scala-native" % "sbt-scala-native"  % "0.1.0")

Create a file ``project/build.properties`` to define the sbt version as follows::

    sbt.version = 0.13.13

define a new ``build.sbt``::

    enablePlugins(ScalaNativePlugin)

    scalaVersion := "2.11.8"

and now you can write your first application in ``./src/main/scala/HelloWorld.scala``::

    package example

    object Main {
      def main(args: Array[String]): Unit =
        println("Hello, world!")
    }

now simply run ``sbt run`` to get everything compiled and have the expected output!

Sbt settings and tasks

3. See `Garbage collectors`_ for details.

Compilation modes
-----------------

Scala Native supports two distinct linking modes:

1. **debug.**

   Default mode. Optimized for shortest compilation time. Runs fewer
   optimizations and is much more suited for iterative development workflow.
   Similar to clang's ``-O0``.

2. **release.**

   Optimized for best runtime performance at expense of longer compilation time.
   Similar to clang's ``-O2`` with addition of link-time optimisation over
   the whole application code.

Garbage collectors
------------------

1. **boehm.**

   Conservative generational garbage collector. More information is available
   at the `project's page <https://www.hboehm.info/gc/>`_.

1. **none.**

   Garbage collector that allocates things without ever freeing them. Useful
   for short-running command-line applications or applications where garbage
   collections pauses are not acceptable.

Publishing
----------

Scala Native supports sbt's standard workflow for the package distribution:

1. Compile your code.
2. Generate a jar with all of the classfiles and NIR files.
3. Publish the jar to `sonatype`_, `bintray`_ or any other 3rd party hosting service.

Once the jar has been published, it can be resolved through sbt's standard
package resolution system.

Cross compilation
-----------------

`sbt-crossproject <https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject>`_ is an
sbt plugin that lets you cross-compile your projects against all three major
platforms in Scala: JVM, JavaScript via Scala.js and native via Scala Native.
It's based on the original cross-project idea from Scala.js and supports the
same syntax for exising JVM/JavaScript cross-projects. Please refer to project's
`README <https://github.com/scala-native/sbt-crossproject/blob/master/README.md>`_
for details.
