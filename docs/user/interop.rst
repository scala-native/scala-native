.. _interop:

Native code interoperability
============================

Scala Native provides an interop layer that makes it easy to interact with
foreign native code. This includes C and other languages that can expose APIs
via C ABI (e.g. C++, D, Rust etc.)

All of the interop APIs discussed here are defined in
``scala.scalanative.native`` package. For brevity, we're going
to refer to that namespace as just ``native``.

Extern objects
--------------

Extern objects are simple wrapper objects that demarcate scopes where methods
are treated as their native C ABI-friendly counterparts. They are
roughly analogous to header files with top-level function declarations in C.

For example to call C's ``malloc`` one might declare it as following:

.. code-block:: scala

    @native.extern
    object libc {
      def malloc(size: native.CSize): native.Ptr[Byte] = native.extern
    }

``native.extern`` on the right hand side of the method definition signifies
that the body of the method is defined elsewhere in a native library that is
available on the library path (see `Linking with native libraries`_.) Signature
of the extern function must match the signature of the original C function
(see `Finding the right signature`_.)

Finding the right signature
```````````````````````````

To find a correct signature for a given C function one must provide an
equivalent Scala type for each of the arguments:

===================== =========================
C Type                Scala Type
===================== =========================
void                  Unit
bool                  native.CBool
char, signed char     native.CChar
unsigned char         native.CUnsignedChar (1)
short                 native.CShort
unsigned short        native.CUnsignedShort (1)
int                   native.CInt
unsigned int          native.CUnsignedInt (1)
long                  native.CLong
unsigned long         native.CUnsignedLong (1)
long long             native.CLongLong
unsigned long long    native.CUnsignedLongLong (1)

struct { int x, y; }  Not supported

Linking with native libraries
`````````````````````````````

In C/C++ one has to typically pass an additional ``-l mylib`` flag to
dynamically link with a library. In Scala Native one can annotate libraries
to link with using ``@native.link`` annotation:

.. code-block:: scala

   @native.link("mylib")
   @native.extern
   object mylib {
     ...
   }

Whenever any of the members of ``mylib`` object are reachable, the Scala Native
linker will automatically link with the corresponding native library.

Variadic functions
``````````````````

One can declare variadic functions like ``printf`` using ``native.CVararg``
auxiliary type:

.. code-block:: scala

   @native.extern
   object stdio {
     def printf(format: native.CString,
                args: native.CVararg*): native.CInt = native.extern
   }

Pointer types
-------------

Scala Native provides a built-in equivalent of C's pointers via
``native.Ptr[T]`` data type. Under the hood pointers are implemented
using unmanaged machine pointers.

Operations on pointers are closely related to their C counterparts and
are compiled into equivalent machine code:

================ ======================== ===================
Operation        C syntax                 Scala Syntax
================ ======================== ===================
Load value       ``*ptr``                 ``!ptr``
Store value      ``*ptr = value``         ``!ptr = value``
Pointer to index ``ptr + i``, ``&ptr[i]`` ``ptr + i``
Load at index    ``ptr[i]``               ``ptr(i)``
Store at index   ``ptr[i] = value``       ``ptr(i) = value``
Pointer to field ``&ptr->name``           ``ptr._N``
Load a field     ``ptr->name``            ``!ptr._N``
Store a field    ``ptr->name = value``    ``!ptr._N = value``
================ ======================== ===================

Where ``N`` is the index of the field ``name`` in the struct.
See `Memory layout types`_ for details.

Memory management
`````````````````

Unlike standard Scala objects that are managed automatically by the underlying
runtime system, one has to manage native pointers manually. The two
standard ways to allocate memory in native code are:

1. **Stack allocation.**

   Scala Native provides a built-in way to perform stack allocations of
   unmanaged memory using ``native.stackalloc`` function:

   .. code-block:: scala

       val buffer = native.stackalloc[Byte](256)

   This code will allocate 256 bytes that are going to be available until
   the enclosing method returns. Number of elements to be allocated is optional
   and defaults to 1 otherwise.

   When using stack allocated memory one has to be careful not to capture
   this memory beyond the lifetime of the method. Dereferencing stack allocated
   memory after the method's execution has completed is undefined behaviour.

2. **Heap allocation.**

   Scala Native's library contains a bindings for a subset of the standard
   libc functionality. This includes the trio of ``malloc``, ``realloc`` and
   ``free`` functions that are defined in ``native.stdlib`` extern object.

   Calling those will let you allocate memory using system's standard
   dynamic memory allocator. Apart from the system allocator one might
   also bind to plethora of 3-rd party allocators such as jemalloc_ to
   serve the same purpose.

.. _jemalloc: http://jemalloc.net/

Undefined behavior
``````````````````

Similarly to their C counter-parts, behavior of operations that
access memory is subject to undefined behaviour for following conditions:

1. Dereferencing null.
2. Out-of-bounds memory access.
3. Use-after-free.
4. Use-after-return.
5. Double-free, invalid free.

Memory layout types
```````````````````

Memory layout types are auxiliary types that let one specify memory layout of
unmanaged memory. They are meant to be used purely in combination with native
pointers and do not have a corresponding first-class values backing them.

* ``native.Ptr[native.CStructN[T1, ..., TN]]``

  Pointer to a C struct with up to 22 fields.
  Type parameters are the types of corresponding fields.
  One may access fields of the struct using ``_N`` helper
  methods on a pointer value:

  .. code-block:: scala

      val ptr = native.stackalloc[native.CStruct2[Int, Int]]
      !ptr._1 = 10
      !ptr._2 = 20
      println(s"first ${!ptr_.1}, second ${!ptr._2}")

  Here ``_N`` computes a derived pointer that corresponds to memory
  occupied by field number N.

* ``native.Ptr[native.CArray[T, N]]``

  Pointer to a C array with statically-known length ``N``. Length is encoded as
  a type-level natural number. Natural numbers are types that are composed of
  base naturals ``Nat._0, ... Nat._9`` and an additional ``Nat.Digit``
  constructor. So for example number ``1024`` is going to be encoded as
  following:

  .. code-block:: scala

      import scalanative.native._, Nat._

      type _1024 = Digit[_1, Digit[_0, Digit[_2, _4]]]

  Once you have a natural for the length, it can be used as an array length:

  .. code-block:: scala

      val ptr = native.stackalloc[CArray[Byte, _1024]]

  Addresses of the first twenty two elements are accessible via ``_N``
  accessors. The rest are accessible via ``ptr._1 + index``.

Byte strings
````````````

Scala Native supports byte strings via ``c"..."`` string interpolator
that gets compiled down to pointers to statically-allocated zero-terminated
strings (similarly to C):

.. code-block:: scala

    import scalanative.native._

    // CString is an alias to Ptr[CChar]
    val msg: CString = c"Hello, world!"
    stdio.printf(msg)

Additionally, we also expose two helper functions ``native.toCString`` and
``native.fromCString`` to convert between C-style and Java-style strings.

Unchecked casts
```````````````

Quite often,C APIs expect user to perform unchecked casts to convert
between different pointer types and/or pointers and integers values. We provide
``obj.cast[T]`` that's defined in ``native.CCast`` implicit class, for this
use case. Unlike Scala's ``asInstanceOf``, ``cast`` doesn't provide any safety
guarantees.

Unsigned integer types
----------------------

Scala Native provides support for four unsigned integer types:

1. ``native.UByte``
2. ``native.UShort``
3. ``native.UInt``
4. ``native.ULong``

They share the same primitive operations as signed integer types.
Primitive operation between two integer values are supported only
if they have the same signedness (they must both signed or both unsigned.)

Conversions between signed and unsigned integers must be done explicitly
using ``signed.toUByte``, ``signed.toUShort``, ``signed.toUInt``, ``signed.toULong``
and conversely ``unsigned.toByte``, ``unsigned.toShort``, ``unsigned.toInt``,
``unsigned.toLong``.
