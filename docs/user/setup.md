# Environment setup

Scala Native has the following build dependencies:

-   Java 8 or newer
-   sbt 1.5.8 or newer
-   LLVM/Clang 6.0 or newer

And following completely optional runtime library dependencies:

-   Boehm GC 7.6.0 (optional)
-   zlib 1.2.8 or newer (optional)

These are only required if you use the corresponding feature.

## Installing sbt

**macOS, Linux, and Windows**

Please refer to [this
link](https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Setup.html) for
instructions for your operating system.

**FreeBSD**

``` shell
$ pkg install sbt
```

**OpenBSD**

``` shell
$ pkg_add sbt
```

**NetBSD**

``` shell
$ pkg_add scala-sbt
```

## Installing clang and runtime dependencies

Scala Native requires Clang, which is part of the
[LLVM](https://llvm.org) toolchain. The recommended LLVM version is the
most recent available for your system provided that it works with Scala
Native. The Scala Native sbt plugin checks to ensure that
`clang` is at least the minimum version shown above.

Scala Native uses the
[Immix](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/speedway/DaCapo/papers/immix-pldi-2008.pdf)
garbage collector by default. You can use the
[Boehm](https://github.com/ivmai/bdwgc) garbage collector instead. If
you chose to use that alternate garbage collector both the native
library and header files must be provided at build time.

If you use classes from the `java.util.zip` for compression
zlib needs to be installed.

*Note:* Some package managers provide the library header files in separate
`-dev` packages.

Here are install instructions for a number of operating systems Scala
Native has been used with:

**macOS**

``` shell
$ brew install llvm
$ brew install bdw-gc # optional
```

*Note 1:* Xcode should work as an alternative if preferred:
<https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835>

*Note 2:* A version of zlib that is sufficiently recent comes with the
installation of macOS.

**Ubuntu**

``` shell
$ sudo apt install clang libstdc++-12-dev
$ sudo apt install libgc-dev # optional
```

**Arch Linux**

``` shell
$ sudo pacman -S llvm clang
$ sudo pacman -S gc # optional
```

*Note:* A version of zlib that is sufficiently recent comes with the
installation of Arch Linux.

**Fedora 33**

``` shell
$ sudo dnf install llvm clang
$ sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools"
$ sudo dnf install gc-devel zlib-devel # both optional
```

**FreeBSD 12.4 and later**

*Note 1:* Only AMD64 and ARM64 architectures are supported.

*Note 2:* Sufficiently recent versions of llvm and zlib come with the
installation of FreeBSD.

``` shell
$ pkg install boehm-gc # optional
```

*Note 3:* Using the boehm GC with multi-threaded binaries doesn\'t work
out-of-the-box yet.

**OpenBSD 7.5 and later**

*Note 1:* OpenBSD support is experimental and limited to only AMD64
architecture.

``` shell
$ pkg_add boehm-gc # optional
```

**NetBSD 9.3 and later**

*Note 1:* NetBSD support is experimental and limited to only AMD64
architecture.

``` shell
$ pkg_add clang
$ pkg_add boehm-gc # optional
```

**Nix/NixOS**

``` shell
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scala-native/scala-native/main/scripts/scala-native.nix
$ nix-shell scala-native.nix -A clangEnv
```

**Windows**

Corporate environments and Windows policies can affect the method used
to setup your environment. The following procedure involves downloading
installers and running the installers using Powershell (Administrative)
to avoid some of these issues. If you have full access to your machine
then you can install using your favorite method.
[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) can
be substituted as needed or desired and are also mentioned above in the
installing [sbt](./sbt.md) documentation.

1.  Download and install Visual Studio Community 2019

<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/>

You may install it via the command line if needed.

``` shell
> .\vs_community__<version>.exe
```

Select the *Workloads* tab and then *Desktop development with C++*
checkbox. The defaults are fine. The *C++ Clang tools for Windows* does
not work so use the next step for details on installing LLVM.

2.  Download and install LLVM

<https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-12.0.1>

Select *LLVM-12.0.1-win64.exe* or newer. Digital signatures are
provided.

You may also install LLVM via the command line, and if needed, install
it into your *C:\\Users\\\<login\>\\AppData\\Local* directory. The
installer will add *LLVM* and the associated directories and files.

``` shell
> .\LLVM-12.0.1-win64.exe
```

3.  Add the binary location to your PATH

Using the install path above, you would add the following:

``` shell
C:\Users\<login>\AppData\Local\LLVM\bin
```

Continue to [sbt](./sbt.md).
