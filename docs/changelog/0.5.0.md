# 0.5.0-SNAPSHOT (mmm dd, 2022)

**WIP**

We are happy to announce the release of Scala Native 0.5.0!

Scala Native is an optimizing ahead-of-time compiler and lightweight managed runtime
designed specifically for Scala.
It is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and with the help
from [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com) along with contributors from the community.

Check out the documentation at
[https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/](https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## TL;DR
* **Not backward compatible with previous releases**,
* Removed `java.net.URL` and `java.net.URI.toURL` related stubs we don't plan to implement.

## Breaking changes
### Broken backward compatibility
Scala Native 0.5.0 breaks backward binary compatibility with previous releases of Scala Native.
Libraries published using version 0.4.x or older must be republished for Scala Native 0.5.x.

### Removal of `java.net` code
Some `java.net.URL` code was added as stubs to help out downstream projects. Java now has a HTTP
client so we don't plan to add the `URL` code to Scala Native.

Third-party libraries may add the removed code listed here into their projects
if they need it for linking.
```scala
package java.net

import scalanative.annotation.stub

class URL(from: String) {
  @stub
  def getPath(): java.lang.String = ???
  @stub
  def getProtocol(): java.lang.String = ???
  @stub
  def openConnection(): java.net.URLConnection = ???
  @stub
  def openStream(): java.io.InputStream = ???
  @stub
  override def hashCode: Int = ???
  @stub
  def toURI(): java.net.URI = ???
  @stub
  def toExternalForm(): java.lang.String = ???
}

package java.net

import scalanative.annotation.stub

class URLClassLoader(args: Array[Object], parent: ClassLoader)
    extends ClassLoader(parent) {
  @stub
  def getURLs(): Array[Object] = ???
  @stub
  def close(): Unit = ???
}

package java.net

import scalanative.annotation.stub

class URLConnection {
  @stub
  def getLastModified(): scala.Long = ???
  @stub
  def connect(): Unit = ???
  @stub
  def getContentType(): String = ???
  @stub
  def getInputStream(): java.io.InputStream = ???
  @stub
  def setRequestProperty(key: String, value: String): Unit = ???
}
```
If we needed to support a third party library for URL we could follow our normal
extension method to add the following implementation in `java.net.URI` based on
Javadoc and JVM output:
```scala
  @scalanative.annotation.stub
  def toURL(): java.net.URL = if (this.isAbsolute()) {
    new URL(this.toString)
  } else {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("URI is not absolute")
  }
```
## Deprecated definitions 

### Removed in this version

* ScalaNativePlugin.scala 'val AutoImport' (deprecated in 0.3.7)

### Introduced in this version
* All newly deprecated declarations are subject to removal in the future.

* posixlib unistd.scala 'sethostname()' is now deprecated because it
  is not part of the POSIX 2018 standard.

* posixlib unistd.scala 'vfork()' is now deprecated because it was removed
  in the POSIX.1-2018 standard.
