# 0.4.3 (2022-01-21)

We're happy to announce the release of Scala Native v0.4.3, which brings support for Scala 3!

This release does also contain performance-critical bug fixes to performing operations on Strings, 
leading to significant improvement of regexes throughput. Furthermore it comes with improvements
to the sbt plugin in the area of incremental compilation and implementation of some missing methods 
from Java standard library.

## Breaking changes in release 0.4.3
The minimal version of Scala 3 supported by Scala Native is 3.1.0, due to fatal blockers in Scala 3.0.x. 
In the future, when improved backward compatibility support in Scala 3.2 would implemented, Scala Native 
might be backported to the older version of the compiler.

### Changes to the main method resolving
In the previous versions of Scala Native main entry point was always resolved based on the companion object defining the main method. 
This behaviour however lead to multiple issues in situations when an actual main method was introduced via inheritance. Because of that issue,
build tools needed to always add `$` suffix to actual main class to make sure that entry method would be found. 
With the 0.4.3 release, Scala Native does generate static method forwarders in the same way as it is done in JVM and Scala.js.
Build tools should make sure to no longer add `$` to the discovered main class name.

### Source compatibity of `stackalloc[T]` and `alloc[T]` methods
No-param methods `scalanative.unsafe.stackalloc[T]` and `scalanative.unsafe.alloc[T]` were removed from Scala 3 `unsafe` package. 
In Scala 2 these methods have been deprecated and it is recommended to use empty-param variants of these methods instead, eg. `scalanative.unsafe.stackalloc[T]()`.
This change was introduced due to changes of how does Scala 3 interpret source code as it could lead to dangerous, hard to debug, runtime errors. 
As an example call to `stackalloc[Byte](10)` in Scala 2 would result in allocating memory of size `10 * sizeof(Byte)`. In Scala 3 however,
the given snippet would be interpreted as `stackalloc[Byte].apply(10)` which is still valid, but leads to allocating `1 * sizeof(Byte)` chunk of memory and 
accessing its 10th element, which would lead to undefined behaviour. 
More information can be found in [#2480](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/pull/2480)

## Known issues
### Cannot create documentation using scaladoc in Scala Native sbt project
When trying to generate documentation using Scaladoc for projects using Scala Native compilation would fail with an exception. 
This issue is common for most of the compiler plugins and was already fixed in Scala 3.1.1 compiler. As a workaround in Scala 3.1.0 we would recomend adjusting sbt build, by filtering out all `-Xplugin` settings from `Compile / doc / scalacOptions`. Workaround can be find in [this discussion](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native/issues/2503#issuecomment-1005290906)
