# 0.4.0 (Jan 14, 2021)

We are happy to announce the release of Scala Native 0.4.0!

Scala Native is an optimizing ahead-of-time compiler and lightweight managed runtime designed specifically for Scala.
It is developed at the [Scala Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and with the help from [VirtusLab](https://virtuslab.com)
along with contributors from the community.

Check out the documentation at [https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/](https://scala-native.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## TL;DR
* **Not backward compatible with previous releases**,
*`NativeConfig` replaces spare set of `NativeX` key settings,
* Java standard library packages `java.time` and `java.text` removed from core repo. Recommended usage of third-party libraries instead,
* `CFuncPtr` is now created by implicit conversion from ordinary `scala.Function`
* Added Scala 2.12 and 2.13 support,
* Added Native JUnit tests plugin,
* Additional C/C++ can be added to compilation pipeline,
* Allowed for cross compilation using custom target triple
* Allowed reflective instantiation by using `@EnableReflectiveInstantiation` annotation,
* Added new Garbage Collector - Concurrent Mark and Parallel Sweep Garbage Collector, called Commix,
* Known bugs fixed

## Breaking changes
### Broken backward compatibility
With this major release we are forced to break backward compatibility with previous releases of Scala Native.
It means that any library published using version 0.4.0-M2 or older would not be compatible to use with Scala Native 0.4.x and afterwards.

### Removal of `java.time` / `java.text`
This release comes with removal of `java.time` and `java.text` packages for Scala Native core. This decision was taken
in order to allow for proper implementation of those modules in third-party library. It's specially important for classes
like `Locale` that are hard to maintain in Scala Native core repo.

Removal of mentioned modules does not create regression in other definitions as long as they're not using directly or transitively one of removed classes.
```scala
val str: String = "Hello Native"
str.toLowerCase()              // works as before
str.toLowerCase(Locale.French) // fails while linking if not provided implementation
```

### `NativeConfig` replaces setting keys 
The current spare set of `NativeX` setting keys is now deprecated in favor of single `NativeConfig` object.

```scala
// build.sbt
nativeConfig ~= {
  _.withMode(build.Mode.releaseFast)
   .withGC(build.GC.immix)
   .withLTO(build.LTO.full)
   .withOptimize(true)
   .withCompileOptions(Nil)
   .withLinkingOptions(Nil)
}
```
Old style settings keys are still respected, but with lower priority than the new config and will be removed at some point in the future.
In the following example resulting `LTO` setting would be set to `thin`
```scala
nativeConfig := nativeConfig.value.withLTO(build.LTO.thin)

nativeLTO := "none"
```

### CFuncPtr syntax change
You no longer need to implement the `CFuncPtrN` trait which is now private for Scala Native implementation.
Instead, you can use an implicit conversion method taking arbitrary `scala.FunctionN` and returning `CFuncPtrN`.

```scala
type Callback = CFuncPtr1[CInt,Unit]
def registerCallback(cFn: Callback) = extern
def fn(n: CInt): Unit = ???

registerCallback(CFuncPtr1.fromScalaFunction(fn))
registerCallback(fn)

registerCallback{n: CInt => println("hello native")}
```

It's now also possible to work with an arbitrary pointer and convert it to `CFuncPtrN` that can be called in your Scala code
or to convert your function to any pointer if your native library needs this.

```scala
import scala.scalanative.unsafe.Ptr
val cFnPtr: CFuncPtr0[CInt] = ???
val fnPtr: Ptr[Byte]    = CFuncPtr.toPtr(cFnPtr)
val fnFromPtr:       = CFuncPtr.fromPtr[CFuncPtr0[CInt]](fnPtr)
```

### Other breaking changes:
* Sbt 0.13.x is no longer supported - upgrade to 1.1.6 or newer.
* The minimal version of Clang working with Scala Native is now 6.0
* `CSize` is now unsigned numeral type
* Usage of signed numeral types for methods expecting `CSize` was deprecated. 

## New features

### Supported Scala versions
We added support for Scala 2.12.13 and 2.13.4, in addition to the existing support for 2.11.12. 

### JUnit Native Plugin
Scala Native now comes with JUnit support out of the box, this means that you can write tests in the same way you would do
for a Scala/JVM or Scala.js project. To enable JUnit tests all you will need to do is to add the two following lines to your `build.sbt`.

```scala
addCompilerPlugin("org.scala-native" % "junit-plugin" % SNVersion cross CrossVersion.full)
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-native" % "junit-runtime" %%% SNVersion % "test"
```

### Reflective instantiation
Since this release you are able to reflectively instantiate definitions marked with the `@EnableReflectiveInstantation` annotation.
It will also make all of its descendants able to be reflectively instantiated.
For definitions marked with this annotation Scala Native plugin would generate definitions of static class initializers
and invoke them just before the `main` method in your final program.
This step would register `LoadableModuleClass` and `InstantiableClass` instances for objects and classes accordingly allowing
them to be accessed later via the provided `scalanative.reflect.Reflect` object methods in your code.
If you have used Scala.js before, it may seem similar to you, as the new implementation uses exactly the same API.

Scala Native does not support full reflection support, although this feature might fix most of the issues that could occur
in users code.

```scala
package x.y.z

@EnableReflectiveInstantation
sealed trait ReflectiveFoo {
  val value: String = "foo"
}

object SingleFoo extends ReflectiveFoo

case class MultipleFoo(times: Int) extends ReflectiveFoo {
  override val value: String = super.value * times
}

for {
  cls <- lookupInstantiatableClass("x.y.z.Foo")
  ctor <- cls.getConstructor(classOf[Int])
  obj <- ctor.newInstance(5)
} yield obj // results in Some(new MultipleFoo(5))

for {
  cls <- lookupLoadableModule("x.y.z.SingleFoo")
  obj <- cls.loadModule
} yield obj // results Some(SingleFoo)
```

### Cross compilation
With the latest release you're able to define a custom target for compiler by providing [LLVM style TargetTriple](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html) in your config.
This change does not change default behaviour of Scala Native sbt plugin, cousing to target host architecture and operating system.

For example, if you're working on Linux and would like to create perfectly suited assembly for some specific version of MacOS without changing your whole build,
you can use ad-hoc sbt setting:
```bash
sbt 'set nativeConfig ~= {_.withTargetTriple("x86_64-apple-darwin<version>")}' myApp/nativeLink
```

We consider changing target triple as a feature for advanced users, and cannot promise it would currently work with any possible configuration yet.
However, the number of supported architectures and operating systems would definitely grow in the future.

> When using Linux / MacOS you can check target triple used in your environment by command `llvm-config --host-target`.

### Native sources in build
With the 0.4.0 release you're able to put your C/C++ sources in the `resources/scala-native` directory inside your project,
so they will be linked and compiled inside the SN pipeline.

As an example you can use it to access macro defined constants and functions or to pass `struct`s from the stack to C functions.
```c
// src/resources/scala-native/example.c
typedef int (*Callback0) (void);

const int EXAMPLE_CONSTANT = 42;

int exec(Callback0 f) {
 return f();
};

```
```scala
// src/main/example.scala
@extern
object example {
 def exec(cb: CFuncPtr0[CInt]): ExecResult = extern

 @name("EXAMPLE_CONSTANT")
 final val someConstant: Int = extern
}
```

### Commix GC
This release also adds a new Garbage Collector - Commix, a parallel mark, and concurrent sweep GC, based on the well known Immix GC.
It reduces GC pause times by utilizing additional processor cores during mark and sweep phases. It was added soon after
the 0.4.0-M2 release, but was only available via an unofficial snapshot.

Remember, it **does not** mean Scala Native is starting to officially support multi-threading!
Commix GC was written in C and uses `pthread` to work. In case if your application needs concurrency support you may try experimental library [scala-native-loop](https://github.com/scala-native/scala-native-loop)

## Bugfixes
* Failures during the build of multiple parallel projects using common jar were fixed,
* Lowered overall memory usage when compiling and linking,
* Value classes are now correctly handled in lambda functions,
* `synchronized` flag in now taken into account when generating methods,
* Constructors are no longer treated are virtual methods, they're always resolved statically,
* Generic `CFuncPtr` can be passed as method arguments,
* Binary operations will no longer with `Nothing` arguments will no longer break compilation,
* Resolving of public method no longer can result in private method with the same name,
* Instances of `java.lang.Class` are now cached can be correctly tested using reference equality,
* Triple-quoted `CString`'s are now correctly escaped,
* Identifiers starting with digits are now correctly handled,
* Fixed errors with too many open files after consecutive runs,
* Fixed crashes when HOME env variable was not set,
* Boehm GC installed using MacPorts is now supported,
* Fixed segmentation fault when trying to access current, unlinked directory,
* `malloc` will now throw `OutOfMemoryError` when it cannot allocate memory,
* `toCString` & `fromCString` now correctly return null,
* Fixed errors with not cleared `errno` when using POSIX `readdir`
* Array operation now throw JVM-compilant `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`,
* Fix bug with `BufferedInputStream.read()` for values bigger then 0x7f,
* `Files.walk` accepts non-directory files,
* Improved IEEE754 specification compliance when parsing strings,
* Fixed infinite loop in `java.io.RandomAccesFile.readLine`,
* Added multiple missing `javalib` classes and methods
