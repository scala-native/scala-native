# 0.4.6 (2022-09-01)

We're happy to announce the release of Scala Native 0.4.6.
The new release brought support for Scala 3.2.0 and multiple bug fixes. 

## Scala 3.2.0 support
The new version of Scala Native is now supporting Scala 3.2.0. 
The latest release of Scala introduced a change to the internal implementation of lazy vals. 
These changes were not compatible with previous releases of the Scala Native compiler plugin.

The latest Scala Native standard library *does not* enforce an upgrade to Scala 3.2.0.
All artifacts are still published using Scala 3.1.x. 
It also includes the Scala 3 standard library, which is now based on the sources of Scala 3.2.0.
The publishing model of native artifacts of Scala 3 standard library is currently flawed. 
Artifacts are not cross-compiled for each Scala 3 version. Instead, we (maintainers), are forced on choosing only 1 version of Scala 3 sources.
Fortunately, Scala 3.2.0 standard library fully sources compatible with 3.1.x releases. 
This oversight would be fixed in the next major version of Scala Native. 

Scala standard library used by this release is based on the following versions:
