# .sbtopts for Java 8
#
# This file exists and has the contents it has to provide one of the
# conditions for interactively building and testing the Scala Native
# plugin after a fresh "git clone".
#
# The "test-tools" and "test-all" commands in build.sbt
# require a soft lower limit of 5 Gigabytes of virtual memory.
# The scala-sbt.org runner sets a limit of 1GB for maximum heap size
# ("-Xmx") even when more physical memory is available.
#
# Continuous integration in the Scala Native project is done on a system
# with 7GB physical memory (RAM). Building on systems with less memory
# may work but is not exercised.
#
# This file assumes the Java 8 default parallel garbage collector
# for server class machines (at least two cores, at least 2GB RAM) is being
# used.
#
#   -Xmx is equivalent to -XXMaxHeapSize
#   -Xms is equivalent to -XXInitialHeapSize
#   -Xss is equivalent to -XXThreadStackSize
#
# The arguably more useful "-J-XX:GCTimeRatio" is not passed by the
# scala-sbt.org runner.

-J-Xmx5G
-J-Xms1G
# -J-Xms1G is the upper bound supplied by scala-sbt.org runner, lower may work.

# Compilation on Scala 2.11 in Release mode might require larger
# thread stack size while performing optimizations. (#2156)
-J-Xss2M

# On systems with more physical memory, one can experiment with locally
# increasing -Xmx to up to 1/4th of physical memory or more.
# Decreases in elapsed wall clock time from 0 to 10% have been observed
# on various systems. Your mileage may vary.
#
# When tuning memory options, the options below may be useful to visualize
# what is actually in use:
#   -J-XX:+PrintCommandLineFlags
#   -J-XX:+PrintFlagsFinal
